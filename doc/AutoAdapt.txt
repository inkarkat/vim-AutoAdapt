DESCRIPTION					       *AutoAdapt-description*

This plugin automatically adapts information like "last modified" timestamps
and copyright notices, or applies any other substitution before each file
save. Where and what is replaced can be configured globally and for each
individual buffer.

The plugin ships with default configuration that handles the most common
copyright notices, e.g.:
    Copyright: (C) 2011-2013 Ingo Karkat ~
and modification timestamps such as
    Last Change: Mon 08 Jul 2013 09:36:03 CET ~
    Modified: 2013 Jul 08 ~

SOURCE									     *

- The regular expression for updating copyright notices is derived from
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_Update_Copyright_Notice_in_Files

RELATED WORKS								     *

- ferallastchange.vim (vimscript #680) is an old plugin that searches for a
  prefix and then updates the timestamp in a certain format.
- timstamp.vim (vimscript #371) takes pattern and replacement parts like this
  plugin (the replacement part also supports some custom tokens e.g. for
  hostname), and is functionally very close.
- timestamp.vim (vimscript #923) is based on timstamp.vim. It allows only one
  pattern and feeds the replacement part to strftime(), making it less
  general.
- lastmod.vim (vimscript #3578) is a short and simple plugin for replacing one
  pattern with a timestamp in the first N lines.

==============================================================================
USAGE							     *AutoAdapt-usage*

The adaptation happens before every buffer save (|BufWritePre| event), e.g.
with the |:write| command. No action required. You can configure
(|g:AutoAdapt_Rules|) and disable this, though:
								*:NoAutoAdapt*
:NoAutoAdapt		Turn off automatic adapting for the current buffer.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					      *AutoAdapt-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim AutoAdapt*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					      *AutoAdapt-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.010 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					     *AutoAdapt-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
				       *b:AutoAdapt_Rules* *g:AutoAdapt_Rules*
The plugin uses a list of rules to adapt the buffer contents on each save. You
can add your own rules, or completely replace the default rules. Rules can
also be overridden for individual buffers with a buffer-local variable. The
rules consist of a |List| of Rule objects: >
    let g:AutoAdapt_Rules = [
    \   {
    \       'name': 'Copyright notice',
    \       'pattern': '\c\<Copyright:\?\d\{4}\>',
    \       'replacement': strftime('%Y'),
    \	    'range': 'modelines'
    \   },
    \	{ ... }
    \]
<
name			An optional, human-readable description of the rule.
pattern			The |regular-expression| as used in a |:substitute|
			command (with the separator character /, or
			substitutionSeparator).
patternexpr		A Funcref (that takes the entire current rule object)
			or a String that is |eval()|ed to yield the pattern.
			Updates the pattern attribute on each run. You can use
			this to e.g. get the current date (via |strftime()|,
			to avoid a match of the current date with |/@!|) into
			the pattern.
replacement		The replacement; you can use text or
			|sub-replace-special|.
range			The (optional) range to which parts of the buffer the
			rule will be applied. It defaults to the empty string
			"", which uses the |g:AutoAdapt_FirstLines| and
			|g:AutoAdapt_LastLines| variables. Alternatives are:
			"modelines", which considers the 'modelines' number of
			lines at both the start and end of the buffer.
			You can also use "%" for the entire buffer, or use
			numbered ranges "11,42".
substitutionSeparator	The separator in the |:substitute|. Change from the
			default "/" to another non-alphanumeric single-byte
			character when the default is cumbersome. |E146|


			     *b:AutoAdapt_FirstLines* *g:AutoAdapt_FirstLines*
The number of lines at the start of the buffer when the rules are applied by
default: >
    let g:AutoAdapt_FirstLines = 25
<			       *b:AutoAdapt_LastLines* *g:AutoAdapt_LastLines*
The number of lines at the end of the buffer when the rules are applied by
default: >
    let g:AutoAdapt_LastLines = 10
The reasoning for a larger "first lines" value is that there may be more
boilerplate code at the file's header. (Also for this reason, the 'modelines'
value is not used by default.)
You can override both values for particular buffers / filetypes with the
buffer-scoped variable.

==============================================================================
INTEGRATION					       *AutoAdapt-integration*

After each write, the plugin sets the variable |b:AutoAdapt| to the number of
rules that have been applied. If no rule was applied, the variable is removed.
The |:NoAutoAdapt| sets the variable to 0 to indicate that the plugin is
disabled for that buffer.
